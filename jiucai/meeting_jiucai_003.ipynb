Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting.\\r\\nIn his important speech, Xi Jinping summarized the economic work in 2024, analyzed the current economic situation, and deployed the economic work in 2025.

Faced with the complex and severe situation of increasing external pressure and increasing internal difficulties, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core united and led the whole party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to respond calmly and take comprehensive measures. The overall economic operation was stable and steady, and high-quality development was steadily promoted. The main goals and tasks of economic and social development are about to be successfully completed. New quality productivity has developed steadily, reform and opening up have continued to deepen, risk resolution in key areas has been orderly and effective, people\\'s livelihood has been solid and effective, and Chinese-style modernization has taken new solid steps.

At the same time, it must be seen that my country\\'s economic foundation is stable, has many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential, and the long-term support conditions and basic trends have not changed. We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence, and strive to transform positive factors from all aspects into development results.\\r\\nThe meeting believes that in practice, we continue to deepen our understanding of the laws of economic work. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in economic work. At critical moments and important nodes, the Party Central Committee promptly judges the situation and makes decisions and arrangements to ensure that my country\\'s economic ship rides the wind and waves and sails steadily. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and an effective government to form an economic order that is both \"let live\" and \"controllable\". We must coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to smooth the circulation of the national economy. We must coordinate the relationship between cultivating new momentum and updating old momentum, and develop new quality productivity according to local conditions. We must coordinate the relationship between optimizing increments and revitalizing stock, and comprehensively improve the efficiency of resource allocation. We must coordinate the relationship between improving quality and increasing total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of China\\'s modernization.\\r\\nFrom December 11 to 12, the Central Economic Work Conference was held in Beijing.
