The overall economic operation was stable and steady, and high-quality development was steadily promoted. The main goals and tasks of economic and social development are about to be successfully completed. New quality productivity has developed steadily, reform and opening up have continued to deepen, risk resolution in key areas has been orderly and effective, people\\'s livelihood has been solid and effective, and Chinese-style modernization has taken new solid steps.

At the same time, it must be seen that my country\\'s economic foundation is stable, has many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential, and the long-term support conditions and basic trends have not changed. We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence, and strive to transform positive factors from all aspects into development results.\\r\\nThe meeting believes that in practice, we continue to deepen our understanding of the laws of economic work. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in economic work. At critical moments and important nodes, the Party Central Committee promptly judges the situation and makes decisions and arrangements to ensure that my country\\'s economic ship rides the wind and waves and sails steadily.
